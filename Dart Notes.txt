1.  Variables are non null by default. You can't assign null to them. 
    To explicitly make them nullbale --> int? aNullableInt = null; 

2. Semicolon are mandatory in dart.

3. Dart doesn't have primitive data types. Every data type is an object.

4. Can't use final and var together as var means that you can override variable multiple times with same data type.
